# How to Add Support for Numbered Options in Quiz Randomizer

The quiz_randomizer.py needs to be updated to support numbered options (like "1. Option", "2. Option").
This requires two changes:

## Step 1: Update the DOCX File Loading Method
Replace the entire "_load_from_docx" method in the QuestionBank class with the content from "fixed_quiz_randomizer.txt".

Steps:
1. Open quiz_randomizer.py in your editor
2. Find the method starting with "def _load_from_docx(self, filename: str) -> None:"
3. Replace that entire method with the code from fixed_quiz_randomizer.txt

## Step 2: Update the Text File Processing
Find the section in the "load_from_file" method that starts with "# Check for multiple choice format"
and replace it with the code from txt_file_loader.txt.

After these changes, the quiz randomizer will be able to process both:
- Letter-style options (a), b), c), etc.)
- Number-style options (1., 2., 3., etc.)

## Testing Your Changes
Use the test files in the "quizzes" directory:
- mixed_format_test.docx - Contains both letter and number formatted options
- numbered_test.txt - Contains number formatted options

Load these test files with the updated quiz_randomizer.py to verify that both formats are handled correctly.
